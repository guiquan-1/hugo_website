#### Introduction
It does feel funny to write this halfway through my exchange journey, but I just wanted to pen down my thoughts before I forget:) Perhaps I'll update this at the end of my exchange journey!

This is a little window into my time abroad-how I learned to navigate a new culture, make a home out of a foreign city, and discover parts of myself I didn’t know existed.

<blockquote style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.4;">
  In Korea, tradition and modernity don’t clash—they coexist, side by side, in neon lights and temple bells.
</blockquote>

This felt especially true during my time at <b>Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU - 성균관대학교)</b>. Every morning when I had class, I'd climb up the mountain where my university was located, where I could see the majestic rooftops of Changdeokgung Palace. I even found out that some rooms in Changdeokgung used to be student dormitories decades ago (until they discontinued that practice to conserve the area), which made me feel like I was part of a long, living history.

#### Academic Experience
Classes in SKKU are relatively easy so far, except for a class about Deep Learning. Some professors are entertaining and try their best to teach well, though I would say that the quality of teaching is markedly worse than that of my home university (Singapore Management University - SMU). Nonetheless, I think that classes are generally enjoyable, especially when some classes get really interactive and include interesting experiences in their curriculum.

For example, one of my classes (Digital Marketing) offered a marketing simulation, allowing students to have firsthand experience on how Google Adsense worked, while another (my favourite) even planned a company visit to Bloomberg for a Bloomberg Terminal Training Session. I even attended a networking dinner with executives from Mirae Asset Financial Group, which gave me valuable insights into their lifestyle and the little nuances that came with networking in Korean culture. And I’ll admit - having the meal fully paid for was a pretty sweet bonus.

#### Daily Life
Most days in Korea were simple but fulfilling. I most of my days cooking at home, hitting the gym, studying, and working on a few side projects. When I wasn’t at my desk, I’d explore different corners of the city - new cafés, bookstores, parks - just soaking in the everyday beauty of life here. Often, I would also go shopping with my friends - really managed to upgrade my wardrobe from those trips:)

Every now and then, I’d also take a day trip out of Seoul to explore the various cities in Korea. One of my favorite getaways was to Gangneung—a trip I’ll never forget (more on that soon).

#### Favourite Moments
Gangneung was hands down one of my favorite trips during exchange. The moment I got off the train, everything just felt calmer - the sea breeze, the slower pace, the smell of coffee from the famous Anmok Beach café street. I spent the day walking along the coast, eating fresh seafood, and just enjoying the quiet, which was a nice change from the usual buzz of Seoul. Watching the sun set over the East Sea was one of those little moments that stuck with me - simple, peaceful, and exactly what I needed.

#### Final Thoughts
If you're considering an exchange, go. You’ll grow in the cracks between languages, you’ll learn from the awkward silences, and you’ll come home a little more courageous - and maybe a lot more into foods that you would have never thought you liked.
