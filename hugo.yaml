      Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm Gui Quan, a curious and driven penultimate student at Singapore Management University (SMU). I love to explore new ideas and perspectives, and my current focus lies in the intersection of analytics and the strategic world of business. 
      I'm particularly fascinated by how data can drive informed decision-making and shape successful business ventures, and aspire to build my own company one day.

      In my free time, you might also find me lost in a book or (attempting to) strategize on the chessboard â€“ my skills there are a work in progress! 

      If any of these resonates with you, I'd love to connect!
